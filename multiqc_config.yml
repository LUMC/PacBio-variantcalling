subtitle: "MultiQC report for the PacBio-variantcalling pipeline"
intro_text: "This report contains QC data for the tools that are part of the PacBio-variantcalling pipeline. Reads are mapped against the reference using pbmm2, and variants are called using GATK4 or DeepVariant. Finally, phased BAM and VCF files are generated using WhatsHap."
report_comment: "The sections under the PGx heading are custom for this project, all other reports are part MultiQC itself"
